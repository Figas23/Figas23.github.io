  <h1>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h1>

  <p>As a Data Scientist I have plenty of professional and personal experience i Exploratory Data Analysis
    envolving libraries such as <strong>Pandas</strong>, <strong>Xarray</strong>, <strong>Numpy</strong>,
    <strong>Matplotlib</strong>, <strong>Seaborn</strong> ...  to dissect, clean, visualize and derive insights from 
    complex datasets.</p>

  <p>Through EDA, I've honed my ability to identify patterns, anomalies, and trends, enabling data-driven
    decision-making and fostering a deeper understanding of the underlying data structures.</p>

  <p>As a huge NBA fan and a big basketball mind I have perform several personal analysis on basketball data. As sports
    evolve I believe that Data Science its crutial for teams to better understand player performance, 
    strategic insights and game dynamics through comprehensive analysis of player statistics, game trends
    and predictive modeling. It empowers teams to gain a competitive edge in a rapidly evolving sport.</p>

  <p>You can check part of my personal experience in Exploratory Data Analysis for Basketball data
