  <h1>JUNO project</h1>

  <p>In this project I used 3 different algorithms Canny, Belkin'Oreilly and Cayula-Cornillon (the last 2 I 
    had to convert from MATLAB and R to Python) to identify Ocean Fronts through satellite image. This
    project involved using APIs to download Satellite data, intensive manipulation and processing of arrays
    and several Python visualization libraries.</p>
    
  <p>The project is currently in operation with scripts running as cron jobs daily to download Sea Surface Temperature
    MUR satellite data, getting the Ocean Fronts identified using each of the 3 algorithms, save everything 
    as a netcdf file and then send it to a THREDDS server.<p>

  <p>You can check all the code in this GitHub repository:
    <a href="https://github.com/CoLAB-ATLANTIC/JUNO">GitHub Repository</a>.</p>

  <p>The work developed in this project was later presented in the EGU Conference in Vienna.</p>

  <h1>ESA-C3S project</h1>

  <p>In +ATLANTIC we are a part of the ESA Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) project as dataset experts. 
    My dataset of expertise is the Land Cover Classification Gridded Maps from 1992 to Present Derived from
    Satellite Observations and I am in charge of creating several Jupyter Notebooks with different analysis 
    in order to help users better understand the capabilities, accuracy, and fitness-for-purpose of the dataset such
    as evaluating urbanization trends in a certion region in the last decades, access the growth of 
    desertification areas, analyze the impacts of climate change in glaciers, ....<p>
