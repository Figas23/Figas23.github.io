  <h1>EMODnet project</h1>

  <p>As a member of the EMODnet project I perform Web Scraping to gather river data (such as flow, temperature, ...)
    from both URLs and APIs using libraries such as <strong>Requests</strong>, <strong>BeautifulSoup</strong>
    and <strong>Selenium</strong>. 
    The project is in operation in a AWS EC2 machine as we retrive this daily data from over 700 stations
    with the cron job task scheduler and made it available an FTP server and in the ERDDAP software.
    Since there are many stations, I monitor which ones are returning data via a map where they stations are marked
    with the colors red (haven't retrieve in the last 30 days), yellow (haven't retrieve in the last 7 days) or green.</p>
    
  <p>You can check part of my personal experience in web scraping
    from this GitHub repository:<a href="https://github.com/Figas23/web_scrapping">Web Scraping Repository</a>.</p>
