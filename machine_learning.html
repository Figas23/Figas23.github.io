  <h1>Satellite Derived Bathimetry</h1>

  <p>I have professional and personal experience developing and deploying Machine Learning models either
    from Scikit-Learn as well as creating my own Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks. 
    I also worked with Machine Learning for time series analysis in order to forecast Electricity Prices
    using algorithms such as <strong>ARIMA</strong> and <strong>SARIMA</strong>, Facebook <strong>Prophet</strong> 
    and Long Short Term Memory (<strong>LSTM</strong>) networks which are Neural Networks, suitable to work
    with time dependencies. </p>
    
  <p>Currently I have been working on a Machine Learning project to predict bathimetry (sea depth) with Satellite
    imagery (using different wavelenghts of the sea surface reflectance). This approach seeks to sidestepping the
    high expenses associated with traditional methods as it provides a more accessible and efficient means of
    creating detailed depth maps for oceans, lakes, and rivers.</p>

  <p>I applied cross-validated ML models from Scikit-Learn such as <strong>RandomForest</strong> and
    <strong>XGBoost</strong>, evaluating the models using metrics like MAE, RMSE and R2-score and performing
    hyperparameter tuning with <strong>GridSearchCV</strong> and <strong>RandomSearchCV</strong>.</p>


  <p>I was able to obtain very satisfactory results where prediction had an RMSE of about 0.7 meters for a 
    group of more than 10000 data points.</p>
